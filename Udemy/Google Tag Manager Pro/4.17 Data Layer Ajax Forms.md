#### **Objective**: To set up form submission tracking on a webpage that uses an AJAX form, ensuring tracking only successful submissions using Google Tag Manager.

### Pre-requisites:
- Access to Google Tag Manager
- Basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript
- Admin or editing rights to the website's GTM and Google Analytics

### Tools Required:
- Google Tag Manager account
- Google Analytics account
- Text editor (for editing and viewing code)
- Web browser with developer tools

### Steps:

#### Step 1: Identify and Understand the Form Type
1. Confirm that the form on the website is an AJAX form. AJAX forms do not cause the page to reload upon submission.
2. Understand that AJAX forms require special listeners in GTM to track submissions because traditional page load triggers do not work.

#### Step 2: Set Up a Custom Auto-Event Listener in GTM
1. **Search for a Custom Listener Script**:
   - Do a Google search for "AJAX form listener for Google Tag Manager".
   - Find a suitable script, such as an AJAX listener designed for GTM.
   
2. **Add the Listener to GTM**:
   - Go to GTM → Triggers → New.
   - Create a new Trigger:
     - Choose Custom Event as the trigger type.
     - Set the event name that corresponds to the AJAX listener script (usually something like "AJAX Complete").
   - Save the trigger.

3. **Implement the Listener Script**:
   - Go to GTM → Tags → New.
   - Add a new Custom HTML tag and paste the AJAX listener script.
   - Set the firing trigger to the one created in the previous step (AJAX Complete).
   - Save the tag.

#### Step 3: Test and Verify Listener Implementation
1. **Refresh GTM and the Webpage**:
   - Refresh the GTM workspace.
   - Reload the webpage where the form resides.
   
2. **Submit the Form**:
   - Enter test data into the form and submit it.
   - Use the GTM Preview mode to ensure that the AJAX Complete event is firing.

#### Step 4: Set Up Tracking for Successful Form Submissions
1. **Create a Data Layer Variable**:
   - In GTM, go to Variables → New.
   - Create a new Data Layer Variable:
     - Name it appropriately (e.g., "Form Submission Status").
     - Set the Data Layer Variable Name to the path that holds the form status in the Data Layer (e.g., "attributes.response.message").

2. **Create a Trigger for Successful Submissions**:
   - Go to Triggers → New.
   - Set up a Custom Event trigger:
     - Use the same event name as before (AJAX Complete).
     - Configure the trigger to fire only if the Data Layer Variable contains the success message (e.g., "Thank you for your message, it has been sent").

3. **Create a Tag to Track Successful Submissions in Google Analytics**:
   - Go to Tags → New.
   - Set up a Google Analytics Event tag:
     - Category: "Form Submission"
     - Action: "Submit"
     - Label: Use the form name or identifier.
   - Set the firing triggers to the trigger created for successful submissions.

#### Step 5: Final Testing and Validation
1. **Refresh GTM and the Webpage**:
   - Make sure all changes are published in GTM.
   - Reload the webpage to reset any session data.

2. **Test Both Successful and Unsuccessful Submissions**:
   - Submit the form with and without required fields filled to ensure the tag only fires for successful submissions.

3. **Verify in Google Analytics**:
   - Check Real-Time events in Google Analytics to confirm that the events are being tracked correctly.
