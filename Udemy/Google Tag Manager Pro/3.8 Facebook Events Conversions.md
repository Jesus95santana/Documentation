#### Purpose:  
To track conversions when users land on a "Thank You" page after submitting a form, using Google Tag Manager (GTM) and Facebook Pixel. This helps in measuring the effectiveness of campaigns, optimizing ad spend, and creating targeted audiences.  
  
#### Scope:  
This SOP is intended for digital marketers setting up conversion tracking on websites where form submissions lead to a distinct "Thank You" page.  
  
#### Prerequisites:  
- Access to Google Tag Manager  
- Access to Facebook Ads Manager  
- A website with a form that redirects to a "Thank You" page upon submission  
  
#### Definitions:  
- **Conversion:** A completed activity, online or offline, that is important to the success of your business.  
- **Facebook Pixel:** A code snippet from Facebook that allows you to measure, optimize, and build audiences for your ad campaigns.  
- **Trigger:** A condition in GTM that fires a tag.  
- **Tag:** A snippet of code (such as the Facebook Pixel) that executes on your site in response to triggers being activated.  
  
#### Tools Required:  
- Google Tag Manager account  
- Facebook Ads account  
  
#### Procedure:  
1. **Set Up the Facebook Pixel:**  
- Log into Facebook Ads Manager.  
- Navigate to the Pixels section under Events Manager.  
- Create a new Pixel if it hasn’t been created yet.  
- Copy the Pixel base code.  
  
2. **Implement the Facebook Pixel in GTM:**  
- Log into Google Tag Manager.  
- Select or create a container for your website.  
- Go to ‘Tags’ and create a new tag.  
- Choose ‘Custom HTML’ and paste the Facebook Pixel base code.  
- Name the tag (e.g., ‘Facebook Pixel Base Code’).  
- Configure the triggering to ‘All Pages’.  
- Save and publish the tag.  
  
3. **Setup the Trigger for the "Thank You" Page:**  
- Go to ‘Triggers’ in GTM and create a new trigger.  
- Name the trigger (e.g., ‘Thank You Page’).  
- Set the trigger type to ‘Page View’.  
- Use the condition where ‘Page URL equals [URL of your Thank You page]’.  
- Save the trigger.  
  
4. **Create the Conversion Tag for the "Thank You" Page:**  
- Go to ‘Tags’ and create a new tag.  
- Name the tag (e.g., ‘Facebook Thank You Page Lead’).  
- Choose ‘Custom HTML’.  
- Insert the snippet of code for a Facebook conversion event (e.g., `fbq('track', 'Lead');`).  
- Configure the trigger to the ‘Thank You Page’ trigger created earlier.  
- Save and refresh to preview.  
  
5. **Verify the Tag Fires Correctly:**  
- Use the GTM preview mode to simulate a form submission.  
- Ensure that the Facebook Thank You Page Lead tag fires when the Thank You page loads.  
- Check the Facebook Pixel Helper to confirm that the ‘Lead’ event is captured.  
  
6. **Publish Changes:**  
- Once verified, go to the GTM workspace.  
- Submit and publish the changes to make the tags live.  
- Name the version appropriately (e.g., ‘Added Thank You Page Lead Conversion Tracking’).  
  
7. **Monitor and Optimize:**  
- Monitor the conversions in Facebook Ads Manager.  
- Adjust the campaign based on the conversion data to optimize ad spend and targeting.  
  
#### Additional Notes:  
- Add parameters to the Facebook Pixel code for more granular tracking (e.g., `fbq('track', 'Lead', {content_name: 'Thank You Page'});`).  
- Consider tracking other conversions such as purchases or sign-ups depending on your website’s goals.
