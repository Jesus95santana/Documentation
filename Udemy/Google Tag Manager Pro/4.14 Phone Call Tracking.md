Tracking phone calls from your website can be crucial for local service-based businesses. This guide will explain how to use Google Tag Manager (GTM) to track phone calls as conversions in Google Analytics, Google Ads, and Facebook Pixel.

**Tools Required:**

2. Navigate to **Triggers** and click **New**.
3. Set Trigger Type to **Just Links**.
4. Select **Some Link Clicks**.
5. Choose **Click URL** from the conditions dropdown.
6. Type in **'tel:'** (this identifies telephone links).
7. Name the trigger (e.g., "Phone Call Clicks") and **Save**.

**Step 2: Setting Up Google Analytics Phone Call Tracking**
1. In GTM, go to **Tags** and click **New**.

5. Under **Google Analytics Settings**, select or configure your GA variable.
6. Set the triggering condition to the trigger created in Step 1.
7. Name the tag (e.g., "GA Phone Call Tracking") and **Save**.
8. **Publish** the changes in GTM.

**Step 3: Verifying in Google Analytics**

4. For the tag setup, select **Google Tag Manager**.
5. Back in GTM, create a new tag for Google Ads Conversion Tracking using the conversion ID and label from Google Ads.
6. Set the trigger as the "Phone Call Clicks" trigger.
7. Name the tag (e.g., "Google Ads Phone Call Conversion") and **Save**.
8. **Publish** the changes.

**Step 5: Setting Up Facebook Pixel Phone Call Tracking**
1. In GTM, create a **New Tag** for **Custom HTML**.
2. Insert the Facebook Pixel Base Code followed by the event code:

   <script>
   fbq('track', 'Lead', {
     content_name: 'Phone Call'
   });
   </script>
   ```
3. Set the trigger to the "Phone Call Clicks" trigger.
