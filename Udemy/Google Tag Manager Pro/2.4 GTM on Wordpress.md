#### Introduction:  
This guide will demonstrate how to install Google Tag Manager (GTM) on a WordPress site. WordPress is a widely used content management system (CMS) that allows for easy plugin installations to enhance site functionality. We'll explore two different methods to install GTM using plugins.  
  
#### Pre-Requisites:  
- Admin access to a WordPress site.  
- A Google Tag Manager account.  
  
#### Method 1: Using "Insert Headers and Footers" Plugin  
  
**Step 1: Access WordPress Admin**  
- Log into your WordPress dashboard with admin credentials.  
  
**Step 2: Install Plugin**

**Step 3: Configure Plugin**

**Step 4: Insert GTM Code**  
- In the plugin settings:  
- Paste the header snippet into the `Scripts in Header` box.
