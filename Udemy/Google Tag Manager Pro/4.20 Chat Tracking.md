#### **Objective:**
To effectively implement and track interactions with a HubSpot chatbot on a specific website page using Google Tag Manager.

**Scope:**
This procedure applies to marketing and web development teams responsible for managing website chat functionality and its analytics.

**Materials Needed:**
- HubSpot Account
- Google Tag Manager Account

   - **2.2.** Retrieve the custom HTML/JavaScript code provided by HubSpot for the chatbot.
   - **2.3.** Log into your website's backend and navigate to the specific page (e.g., Chatbot page).
   - **2.4.** Embed the HubSpot code into the HTML of the desired page, typically before the closing `</body>` tag.

**3. Setting Up Google Tag Manager:**

     - **5.1.2.** Configure the tag to track type "Event."
     - **5.1.3.** Set category, action, label based on the chat event (use the event name like "HubSpot conversation started").
   - **5.2.** Define the trigger for this GA tag as the custom event triggered by chat interaction.
   - **5.3.** Save and name the tag (e.g., "GA - Chatbot Interaction").

**6. Testing and Validation:**
   - **6.1.** Preview the configuration in Google Tag Manager to test the setup.
   - **6.2.** Initiate a chat in the chatbot and verify that the events are being captured in Google Analytics real-time reporting.
   - **6.3.** Adjust configurations as necessary based on the test results.
