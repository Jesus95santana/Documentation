#### **Objective:**
To implement and validate a tracking system for successful form submissions that trigger a popup thank you message, using Google Tag Manager (GTM).

**Scope:**
This procedure applies to web forms that display a thank you message in a popup upon successful submission, without redirecting from the current page.

**Required Tools:**
- Google Tag Manager Account
- Access to website's HTML and JavaScript
- Web browser with developer tools

**Procedure:**

1. **Test Form Submission Behavior:**
   - Navigate to the form page on your website.
   - Attempt to submit the form with required fields empty to confirm that the popup does not appear.
   - Submit the form with all required fields filled to ensure the popup thank you message appears as expected.

2. **Identify Popup Message Element:**
   - Right-click on the thank you message in the popup and select "Inspect" to open the browser’s developer tools.
   - Identify the HTML element containing the thank you message. Note the element’s ID or class for later use.

3. **Setup in Google Tag Manager:**
   - Login to your Google Tag Manager dashboard.
   - Navigate to **Triggers** and select **New** to create a new trigger.

4. **Configure Visibility Trigger:**
   - Set the trigger type to **Element Visibility**.
   - Choose to use either ID or CSS Selector based on the element identified in step 2.
   - Enter the ID or CSS Selector in the appropriate field.
   - Set the trigger to check multiple times on the page to capture popup visibility changes.
   - Set minimum visibility percentage as required (default 50%).
   - Save the trigger with a descriptive name, e.g., "Successful Submission Popup".

5. **Verify Trigger Configuration:**
   - Refresh the GTM workspace and test the form submission on your site.
   - Ensure the Element Visibility trigger fires only for successful submissions, by checking the debug panel in GTM.

6. **Setup Tag for Tracking Successful Submissions:**
   - In GTM, navigate to **Tags** and click **New**.
   - Choose a tag type suitable for your tracking purpose (e.g., Google Analytics event).
   - Configure the tag to fire on the "Successful Submission Popup" trigger.
   - Define the event parameters such as category, action, and label (e.g., Category: "Form", Action: "Submit", Label: "Popup Thank You").
   - Save the tag with a descriptive name, e.g., "GA Popup Form Submission".

7. **Test and Publish:**
   - Use the GTM preview mode to test the setup. Make both successful and unsuccessful submissions to ensure the tag fires only for successful ones.
   - Once verified, publish the changes in GTM.

8. **Monitor and Adjust:**
   - Monitor the data in your analytics tool to ensure accurate tracking.
   - Make adjustments in GTM if any discrepancies are found or updates are needed.
