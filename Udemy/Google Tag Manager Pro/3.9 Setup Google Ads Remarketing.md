#### **Objective:**  
To effectively set up a Google Ads remarketing code using Google Tag Manager to enhance targeting and tracking capabilities in marketing campaigns.  
  
**Scope:**  
This SOP applies to digital marketers and website administrators responsible for implementing tracking mechanisms for Google Ads.  
  
**Materials Needed:**  
- Google Ads account  
- Google Tag Manager account  
- Access to website's backend (for code verification)  
  
**Procedure:**  
  
1. **Access Google Ads Account:**  
- Log in to your Google Ads account.  
  
2. **Locate Remarketing Tag:**  
- Navigate to ‘Tools and Settings’.  
- Click on ‘Audience Manager’ under the ‘Shared Library’ section.  
- Select ‘Audience Sources’.  
- Find the ‘Google Ads tag’ section and click on ‘Details’, then select ‘Tag Setup’.  
  
3. **Choose Tag Setup Method:**  
- Opt for 'Use Google Tag Manager'.  
- Copy the provided ‘Configuration ID’ (here referred to as Confirgin ID).  
  
4. **Switch to Google Tag Manager:**  
- Log into your Google Tag Manager account.  
- Click on ‘New Tag’ to create a new tag setup.  
  
5. **Configure Tag in Google Tag Manager:**  
- Choose ‘Google Ads Remarketing’ as the tag type (this option is pre-configured by Google).  
- Paste the copied ‘Configuration ID’ into the required field.  
  
6. **Create a Custom Variable:**  
- Click on ‘Variables’ then select ‘New’.  
- Choose ‘Variable Configuration’ and select ‘Constant’.  
- Enter the ‘Configuration ID’ as the value for this variable.  
- Name the variable (e.g., ‘G Ads Remarketing Code Account’) for easy identification.  
- Save the variable.  
  
7. **Implement Tag with Custom Variable:**  
- Return to your tag setup, and instead of pasting the ‘Configuration ID’ directly, use the variable you created.  
- This step ensures easier management if updates are needed later.  
  
8. **Set up Trigger for the Tag:**  
- Configure the trigger to fire on all pages to ensure comprehensive data collection.  
- Attach the trigger to your Google Ads Remarketing tag.  
  
9. **Verify Tag Installation:**  
- Save your tag settings and refresh Google Tag Manager.  
- Install the ‘Google Tag Assistant’ Chrome extension if not already installed.  
- Enable the extension and refresh your webpage to verify that the remarketing tag fires correctly.  
  
10. **Publish Changes:**  
- Once confirmed that the tag is firing correctly, return to Google Tag Manager.  
- Click on ‘Submit’ to finalize and publish your changes.  
  
11. **Documentation and Reporting:**  
- Document the setup process, including the Configuration ID and any notes on custom variable setup.  
- Report the completion of setup to relevant stakeholders.  
  
**Review and Maintenance:**  
Regularly check the performance of the Google Ads Remarketing tag through Google Tag Manager and Google Ads interface. Update the Configuration ID variable as needed, particularly if changes to the Google Ads account occur.
