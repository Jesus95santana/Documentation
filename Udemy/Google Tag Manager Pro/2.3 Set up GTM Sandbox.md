#### Objective:  
To provide a detailed guide on setting up Google Tag Manager (GTM) on a sandbox website, enabling safe practice and testing of GTM skills without affecting live sites.  
  
#### Resources Needed:  
- Google Chrome browser  
- Internet access  
- Google account  
  
#### Tools:  
- Google Tag Manager  
- Adswerve Data Layer Inspector Plus Chrome Extension  
  
#### Procedure:  
  
1. **Prepare the Environment:**  
- Open the Google Chrome browser.  
- Ensure you are logged into your Google account. If you do not have a Google account, create one at https://accounts.google.com/SignUp.  
  
2. **Install Chrome Extension:**  
- Navigate to the Chrome Web Store.  
- Search for "Adswerve Data Layer Inspector Plus".  
- Click "Add to Chrome" to install the extension.  
  
3. **Access Google Tag Manager:**  
- Go to https://tagmanager.google.com/.  
- Click "Create Account" if you do not already have one.  
- Enter a name for your account (e.g., Sandbox Site).  
- For container name, use the URL of the sandbox (e.g., gtmsandbox.ryanwightside.com).  
- Set the target platform to "Web" and click "Create".  
  
4. **Obtain Container ID:**  
- Once the container is created, locate the container ID in the dashboard. It is typically formatted as "GTM-XXXXXX".  
- Copy this container ID for later use.  
  
5. **Configure Adswerve Data Layer Inspector:**  
- Click on the Adswerve Data Layer Inspector Plus icon in the Chrome toolbar.  
- Enable "Inspect" mode by clicking the checkbox.  
- Click the "Add functionality" button.  
- Enable "Insert GTM container" by checking the box next to it.  
- Paste the copied GTM container ID into the designated field. Remove any prefix like "GTM-" from the ID.  
- Under the host field, input "gtm sandbox" or the sandbox site URL without the "http://" or "https://".  
  
6. **Activate GTM on Sandbox:**  
- After configuring the extension, click "Save".  
- Refresh the sandbox page to initiate the changes.  
- To verify installation, activate "Preview" mode in Google Tag Manager:  
- Go back to the Google Tag Manager dashboard.  
- Navigate to "Workspaces", select your container, and click "Preview".  
- Return to the sandbox site and refresh the page.  
- Look for a Google Tag Manager box at the bottom of the sandbox website page. If it appears, GTM is working correctly.  
  
7. **Testing and Validation:**  
- Test various GTM tags and triggers within the sandbox environment to ensure they are firing as expected.  
- Use the GTM debug mode and the data layer inspector to troubleshoot and refine setups.  
  
#### Notes:  
- This setup is for the sandbox environment only and changes will only reflect on your local machine.  
- For live site implementations, follow the standard GTM installation procedures which involve adding GTM snippets directly to the website's code.
