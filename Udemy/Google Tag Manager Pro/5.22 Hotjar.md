#### **Objective:**
To gather insights into why potential customers hesitate or decide not to purchase a product, using feedback collected via Hotjar, and to utilize these insights to enhance marketing strategies and improve conversion rates.

**Scope:**
This SOP is applicable for use on websites with moderate to high traffic, aiming to optimize user experience and sales conversion through direct visitor feedback.

**Tools Needed:**
- Hotjar account
- Google Tag Manager account
- Access to the website’s backend or CMS

**Procedure:**

1. **Setting Up Hotjar:**
   - **1.1.** Log into your Hotjar account. If you do not have an account, create one by registering at www.hotjar.com.
   - **1.2.** Avoid direct integration with Google Tag Manager for privacy concerns. Instead, manually integrate Hotjar with your site.
   - **1.3.** Navigate to the ‘Settings’ or ‘Tracking Code’ section in Hotjar, and copy the site ID.

2. **Integrating Hotjar with Google Tag Manager:**
   - **2.1.** Log into Google Tag Manager (GTM).
   - **2.2.** Create a new tag and select Hotjar as the tag type.
   - **2.3.** Paste the copied Hotjar site ID into the configuration settings.
   - **2.4.** Set up triggering conditions for the tag. For initial setup, apply the tag to all pages.

3. **Creating a Poll in Hotjar:**
   - **3.1.** In Hotjar, navigate to ‘Polls’ and click on ‘New Poll’.
   - **3.2.** Set up the poll question. Example: “What is stopping you from buying [Product Name] today?”
   - **3.3.** Remove unnecessary response options, such as request for a callback if it's not relevant to your strategy.
   - **3.4.** Customize the ‘Thank You’ message post-poll submission.
   - **3.5.** Define the appearance and targeting settings of the poll. Specify whether the poll should appear on specific pages or all pages, and adjust visibility settings for desktop and mobile.
   - **3.6.** Set behavioral triggers for the poll. For example, set a delay of 30 seconds before the poll appears, or configure it to appear when a user scrolls halfway down the page.

4. **Data Collection and Analysis:**
   - **4.1.** Monitor responses to the poll through the Hotjar dashboard.
   - **4.2.** Periodically review the responses to identify common themes and concerns.
   - **4.3.** Compile the feedback into categories such as price sensitivity, product features, competitors, etc.

5. **Applying Insights:**
