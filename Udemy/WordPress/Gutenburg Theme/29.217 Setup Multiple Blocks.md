#### **Objective:**
To create a new version of a WordPress block theme using a clean and modern approach for file and folder organization.

**Scope:**
This SOP is intended for developers looking to structure a WordPress theme that is scalable, maintainable, and adheres to best practices for file organization.

**Tools Needed:**
- Local WordPress development environment (e.g., LocalWP)
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or any preferred code editor
- Access to WordPress Admin Dashboard
- Command Line Interface (CLI) or Terminal

**Procedure:**

1. **Prepare the Development Environment:**
   - Open your local WordPress site.
   - Navigate to the site folder: `public > wp-content > themes`.
   - Identify the existing theme folder you wish to duplicate (e.g., `fictional-block-beam`).

2. **Duplicate the Theme Folder:**
   - Right-click on the theme folder and select "Copy."
   - Right-click in the same directory and select "Paste" to create a duplicate.
   - Rename the duplicate folder to a unique name (e.g., `fictional-clean`).

3. **Modify Theme Information:**
   - Open the new theme folder in Visual Studio Code.
   - Navigate to `style.css`.
   - Change the `Theme Name:` value to a new name (e.g., `Fictional Clean Blocks`).
   - Save the file.

4. **Activate the New Theme:**
   - Go to the WordPress Admin Dashboard.
   - Navigate to `Appearance > Themes`.
   - Find the new theme (`Fictional Clean Blocks`) and click "Activate."

5. **Organize Theme Files:**
   - In VS Code, create a new directory inside the theme folder named `src`.
   - Inside `src`, create subfolders for each block (e.g., `footer`).
   - In each subfolder, create necessary files (`block.json`, `render.php`, `index.js`).

6. **Set Up `block.json`:**
   - In the `footer` folder, open `block.json`.
   - Define properties like `apiVersion`, `name`, `title`, `editorScript`, and `render` pointing to respective files.

7. **Configure Auto-loading:**
   - Open `functions.php`.
   - Comment out or remove lines manually loading old blocks.
   - Add new PHP function to register blocks from metadata using `register_block_type_from_metadata`.

8. **Automate Asset Building:**
   - In the project root, open `package.json`.
   - Add a script in the scripts section to use WP Scripts for building assets:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "blocks": "wp-scripts start"
     }
     ```
   - Run `npm run blocks` in a separate terminal to start watching changes in the `src` folder.

9. **Test the Theme:**
   - Refresh your WordPress site to see changes.
   - Navigate to the footer area to confirm the new setup.

10. **Edit and Debug:**
   - Modify `render.php` for desired frontend output.
   - Update `index.js` to ensure the block appears correctly in the WordPress editor.
   - Debug and make necessary adjustments based on the site and editor behavior.

**Verification:**
Ensure that the new theme and blocks load correctly without errors in both the site frontend and the admin editor. Check the console and WordPress debug logs for any warnings or errors.
