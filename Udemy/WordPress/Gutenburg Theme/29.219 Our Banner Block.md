#### **Objective:**
To update and migrate the banner block to a new setup in a WordPress development environment.

**Tools Required:**
- Code editor with PHP and JavaScript support
- WordPress environment set up locally or on a server
- Access to WordPress Admin area
- Terminal or command line interface
- Node Package Manager (NPM) installed

**Procedure:**

1. **Preparation:**
   - Ensure that the `functions.php` file and the blocks folder (`/src/blocks/`) are clean and organized. Remove any unnecessary placeholder blocks and code.
   - Download necessary files from previous lessons if you haven’t updated the placeholder blocks yourself.

2. **Set Up Development Environment:**
   - Open two terminals:
     - In the first terminal, run `npm start` to start the development server.
     - In the second terminal, run `npm run blocks` to compile block scripts.

3. **Update Banner Block:**
   - Duplicate a similar block folder in `/src/` for structure. For example, duplicate the `header` block folder and rename it to `banner`.
   - Update `block.json` inside the new `banner` folder:
     - Change the block name and title to “banner”.
   - Replace `render.php` in the `banner` folder with appropriate PHP code from an existing similar block or create as necessary.
   - Update `edit.js`:
     - Import necessary JavaScript modules and WordPress components.
     - Modify or add new attributes, ensuring all properties are correctly set.
     - Implement interactive elements like background image selection and dynamic tags.
   - Ensure all JavaScript and PHP code follows WordPress coding standards and best practices.

4. **Register New Block in WordPress:**
   - Go to `functions.php`:
     - Remove old block registrations if they exist.
     - Add a new line to register the `banner` block script after updating it with new paths and dependencies.

5. **Test in WordPress Admin:**
   - Access the WordPress admin area and navigate to the page or post editor to insert the new banner block.
   - Check for functionality such as adding images, changing text, and saving the block.
   - Debug any issues using the browser console and ensure the block behaves as expected.

6. **Commit Changes:**
   - Use version control (e.g., Git) to add and commit the updated files.
   - Provide a clear commit message, e.g., “Update banner block to new setup”, and push to the repository.
