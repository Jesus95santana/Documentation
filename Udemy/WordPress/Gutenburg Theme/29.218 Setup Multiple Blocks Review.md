#### **Objective:**
To streamline and organize code for a modern block development approach using JSX and PHP in a WordPress environment, ensuring consistent editor and front-end experiences.

**Scope:**
This procedure applies to developers managing and customizing themes using block-based development in WordPress.

**Tools Needed:**
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Node Package Manager (npm)
- Command line interface (Terminal or equivalent)

**Procedure:**

1. **Setup Development Environment:**
   - Open VS Code and navigate to the project’s root directory.
   - Ensure the active theme is correctly set under Appearance > Customize in the WordPress dashboard.

2. **Start Development Servers:**
   - Open VS Code’s integrated terminal.
   - Run `npm start` to compile and watch changes in the existing code.
   - Open a second terminal tab and run `npm run blocks` to handle block compilation tasks.

3. **Modify Footer Block:**
   - Navigate to `/src/footer` folder.
   - Open `index.js` and locate the edit function.
   - Replace placeholder text within the edit function to match the desired footer output.
   - Save changes and refresh the WordPress customize screen to view updates.

4. **Refactor Code for Maintainability:**
   - In the `/src/footer` folder, create a new file named `edit.js`.
   - Define a new function named `Edit` that returns the updated JSX code for the footer.
   - Import this function into `index.js` by adding `import Edit from './edit';` at the top of the file.
   - Replace the old edit function call in `index.js` with the new `Edit` function.
   - Save all changes and verify in the WordPress editor that the footer updates correctly.

5. **Enhance Selection Visibility in Editor:**
   - In `edit.js`, wrap the returned JSX code with a `<div>` and apply a class for styling and interaction.
   - Import `useBlockProps` from `@wordpress/block-editor` at the top of the file.
   - Define `const blockProps = useBlockProps();` and spread `...blockProps` within the wrapper `<div>`.
   - Save changes and refresh the editor to ensure the block is now selectable and highlighted when active.

6. **Clean Up Old Files:**
   - Navigate to the old blocks directory and delete deprecated files no longer in use to keep the project clean and organized.

7. **Duplicate and Modify for New Blocks:**
   - Copy the entire `/src/footer` folder and rename it to `/src/header` for creating a similar header block.
   - Adjust the internal references and placeholder texts within the new folder to reflect its purpose as a header.
   - Perform similar steps for other blocks like events and blogs, ensuring each has its unique setup and files.

8. **Register New Blocks in PHP:**
   - Open `functions.php` and duplicate the line used to register the footer block.
   - Modify the duplicated line to register the new header block, changing identifiers and paths as necessary.
   - Repeat registration for other new blocks ensuring each block is correctly linked in PHP.

9. **Test and Validate Changes:**
   - Refresh the WordPress front-end and editor to ensure that all new blocks appear correctly and are functional.
   - Check that the editor experience reflects the changes, and blocks are selectable and styled appropriately.
