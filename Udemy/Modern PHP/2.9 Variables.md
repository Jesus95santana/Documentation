#### Introduction to Variables
- **Purpose of Variables**: Variables in PHP are used to store data which can range from user addresses to product prices.
- **Analogy**: Variables are compared to boxes used in moving, where the label on the box describes its contents. In PHP, the variable name serves as the label, and the data stored is the content.

#### Creating a Variable in PHP
1. **Starting Clean**: Begin with a clear index file, retaining only the opening PHP tag.
2. **Syntax**: Create a variable by typing `$age;`. Variables in PHP:
   - Must start with a `$` (dollar sign) which signals PHP to allocate memory to store the variable's data.
   - Follow with a name that can include alphabetic characters, numbers, and underscores. However, it cannot start with a number, and special characters like `@` are not allowed.

#### Rules for Naming Variables
- **Descriptive Names**: Use clear and descriptive names to indicate what the variable stores. Example: `totalPrice` is preferred over vague abbreviations like `TP`.
- **Avoid Single Letters**: Except in loops (like `i` in a for-loop), single-letter variable names should be avoided as they are not descriptive.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent spelling and case (upper or lower) to avoid confusion. Mixing cases can make the code unreadable.
- **Avoid Generic Names**: Specific names help in identifying the type of data stored. For example, `userData` is more descriptive than just `data`.

#### Variable Naming Conventions
- **Camel Casing**: `camelCasing` - Begins with a lowercase letter; subsequent words start with uppercase letters. Preferred for its readability.
- **Pascal Casing**: `PascalCasing` - Similar to camel casing, but the first word also starts with an uppercase letter.
- **Snake Casing**: `snake_casing` - Uses lowercase letters with underscores separating words.

#### Best Practices
- **Choose a Convention**: Stick to one naming convention to maintain uniformity across your code.
- **Be Descriptive**: Opt for names that clearly describe the variable's purpose to enhance code readability and maintainability.
- **Abbreviations**: If necessary, use common abbreviations that are understandable to other developers.
