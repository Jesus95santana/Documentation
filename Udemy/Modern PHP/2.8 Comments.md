**Overview:**
The text discusses the various methods of making comments in PHP, which are crucial for adding explanatory notes directly into the code. Comments are ignored by the PHP interpreter and serve purely for the benefit of the programmer or other programmers who might read the code.

**Types of Comments in PHP:**

1. **Single-Line Comments:**
   - **Syntax:** Begin with two forward slashes `//`.
   - **Usage:** Anything following the `//` on the same line is treated as a comment and not executed as code.
   - **Example:** Placing a single-line comment above an echo statement to explain its function.
   - **Limitation:** Extends only to the end of the line; starting a new line of text without prefixing with `//` or another comment syntax will be treated as code, potentially causing errors.

2. **Multi-Line Comments:**
   - **Syntax:** Start with `/*` and end with `*/`.
   - **Usage:** Allows comments to span multiple lines, making it suitable for longer explanations.
   - **Flexibility:** Text can be broken up over several lines between these markers, and all of it is considered part of the comment.
   - **Example:** Useful for detailed descriptions or blocking out sections of code temporarily.

3. **Alternative Single-Line Comments:**
   - **Syntax:** Begin with a hash `#`.
   - **Usage:** Functions the same as the double forward slash `//` for single-line comments.
   - **Popularity:** Less common than `//`, but still recognized by PHP.

**Functionality and Role of Comments:**
- **Purpose:** Mainly used for documentation within the code to help developers understand the purpose, functionality, or specific details about the code implementation.
- **Interpreter Behavior:** PHP interpreter completely ignores comments, meaning they do not affect the execution or output of the code in any way.
- **Visibility:** Comments do not appear in any previews or outputs; only non-commented code (like echo statements) is processed and displayed.
