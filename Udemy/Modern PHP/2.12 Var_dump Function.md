**Introduction to PHP Functions:**
- Functions in PHP are a set of instructions aimed at performing specific tasks. They are a crucial feature used to execute reusable code blocks.

**Difference Between Functions and Keywords:**
- Keywords are core elements of the PHP language that cannot be altered or disabled. Examples include `if`, `else`, `while`, etc.
- Functions, unlike keywords, can be enabled or disabled. This is because some functions might be considered risky or unnecessary and disabling them can prevent their misuse.

**Why Disable Functions?**
- Some functions in PHP are seen as questionable or potentially harmful if used incorrectly. Disabling such functions enhances security by preventing accidental usage by developers.

**Availability and Variety:**
- PHP houses hundreds of functions, each designed for different tasks ranging from file manipulation to data encryption.
- In contrast, PHP has only a limited number of keywords.

**Function Usage in the Course:**
- The course will introduce the use of specific PHP functions, starting with `var_dump()`, a function used to output a value and its data type on the screen.

**Variable Dump (`var_dump`) Function:**
- The `var_dump()` function is used for debugging by displaying the value and its type, which helps in understanding what data is being handled.
- Example usage: Typing `var_dump(29);` will output the integer 29 and indicate that it is an integer data type.

**Practical Application:**
- Initially, the course will utilize the `var_dump()` function to explore different data types in PHP, aiding learners in understanding how data is structured and manipulated in the language.
