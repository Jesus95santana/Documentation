**Overview:**
This guide introduces the basics of creating and running PHP scripts to generate dynamic web content, using Replet as the platform. It differentiates between static and dynamic websites, explains the roles of web servers and PHP interpreters, and provides step-by-step instructions on creating PHP files and viewing their outputs.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **PHP Interpreter vs. Web Server:**
   - **PHP Interpreter:** Transforms PHP code into machine-readable code (HTML).
   - **Web Server:** Handles the delivery of files to the browser.

2. **Static vs. Dynamic Websites:**
   - **Static Websites:** Deliver the same content to all users, regardless of their actions.
   - **Dynamic Websites:** Content changes based on user interactions, typically powered by languages like PHP.

3. **Setting Up PHP Files:**
   - PHP files must have a `.php` extension to be processed by the PHP interpreter.
   - Inside PHP files, you can write HTML code because the output of PHP is HTML.

**Step-by-Step Guide to Creating a PHP Script in Replet:**
1. **Creating a PHP File:**
   - Navigate to the file tree and create a new file named `index.php`.
   - Optionally, include initial PHP or HTML code inside this file.

2. **Writing HTML inside PHP Files:**
   - Example: Add `<h1>Hello World</h1>` inside `index.php`.
   - Refresh the preview (not the whole browser) to see changes.

3. **Saving and Refreshing:**
   - Use Ctrl+S (Command+S on Mac) to save changes. Replet automatically refreshes the preview.

4. **Creating Additional PHP Files:**
   - Repeat the process to create another file, e.g., `about.php`.
   - Write distinct content to differentiate it from `index.php`.

5. **Viewing Different PHP Files:**
   - Update the URL in a new browser tab to point to `about.php` to view its content.

6. **Default File Delivery:**
   - Web servers typically deliver `index.php` or `index.html` by default if no specific file is mentioned in the URL.
