**Detailed Summary:**

**Introduction to PHP Mode:**
- The focus is on editing the `index.php` file, with other distractions minimized (e.g., closing the sidebar in the IDE).
- PHP mode is initiated by using PHP tags in the file. This mode tells the PHP interpreter to execute the instructions between these tags.

**Using PHP Tags:**
- PHP tags are denoted by `<?php` and `?>`.
- The lecturer demonstrates adding the first pair of PHP tags at the top of the `index.php` file.
- Entering PHP mode allows the execution of various server-side tasks such as sending emails, processing transactions, or user registrations.
- It's crucial to clearly delineate which parts of the file are PHP (using PHP tags) and which are plain HTML.

**PHP Inside HTML:**
- PHP tags can be embedded within HTML tags to create dynamic content. For example, replacing the content inside `<h1>` tags with PHP tags removes the text in the preview, showcasing how PHP can dynamically alter HTML content.

**HTML Inside PHP Tags:**
- Attempting to include HTML tags within PHP tags (e.g., moving `<h1>` tags inside PHP tags) leads to errors.
- This error occurs because the PHP interpreter strictly requires valid PHP syntax within PHP tags, analogous to following grammar rules in human languages.

**Understanding Errors and Syntax:**
- Errors in PHP are often due to syntax violations within PHP tags, similar to grammatical errors in language.
- The PHP interpreter requires adherence to PHP syntax rules to process the code without errors.
