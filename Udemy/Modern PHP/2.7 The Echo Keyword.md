#### Introduction to Keywords
- **Definition**: Keywords in PHP are reserved words that perform specific actions recognized by the PHP interpreter.
- **Resource**: Official list of PHP keywords can be found in the provided PHP documentation link.

#### Usage of PHP Tags
- **Simplification**: Remove all PHP tags except the opening tag when only PHP code is present in the file.
- **Reason**: Closing PHP tags are optional if not exiting PHP mode, enhancing readability.

#### Echo Keyword
- **Function**: The `echo` keyword outputs content, commonly used for displaying text.
- **Example**: Writing `echo "hello world";` in PHP outputs the text "hello world" on the web page.
- **Syntax Notes**:
  - Messages must be enclosed in quotes (double quotes used in the example).
  - Statements end with a semicolon to denote completion.

#### Understanding Statements and Keywords
- **Statement**: Describes a single line of code or instruction to the machine, similar to a sentence in English.
- **Keyword vs. Statement**: A keyword is a single reserved word, while a statement might contain one or more keywords and forms a complete instruction.
- **Sequential Execution**: PHP executes code from top to bottom; the order of code matters.
