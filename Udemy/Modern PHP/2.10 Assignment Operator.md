#### Introduction to Operators
- **Definition**: An operator is a symbol or character that processes a value to produce a new value.
- **Purpose**: Operators transform existing values into new ones.
- **Resource**: The PHP documentation page on operators is provided for detailed reference.

#### Understanding the Assignment Operator
- **Function**: The assignment operator (`=`) is used to store values in a variable.
- **Usage**: To assign a value, type the variable name, followed by `=` and the value (e.g., `$age = 29`).
- **Numbers vs. Text**: Numbers do not require quotes when being assigned to variables, unlike text strings.

#### Working with Variables
- **Creation and Usage**: Variables are created to store data that can be referenced multiple times throughout a PHP script. 
- **Example**: Setting `$age = 29` and then using `echo $age` to display the age.
- **Memory Management**: PHP stores variable values in memory and replaces variable references with the stored value when encountered in the script.

#### Updating Variables
- **Process**: Variables can be updated using the same syntax as when they are created (e.g., `$age = 30`).
- **Efficiency**: PHP efficiently manages memory by updating existing variables without requiring additional resources.

#### Case Sensitivity
- **Importance**: Variable names in PHP are case-sensitive, meaning `$age` and `$Age` are considered different variables.
- **Implications**: Misnaming a variable can lead to errors and unexpected behavior since PHP does not throw errors for such typos.
