#### Objective
To guide beginners through the process of setting up a local PHP development environment using Replit, an online integrated development environment (IDE).

#### Scope
This procedure applies to individuals or groups seeking to develop and test PHP applications in a controlled, local setting without the need for installing software locally.

#### Prerequisites
- Access to an internet-connected computer.
- Basic knowledge of web development and PHP.

#### Tools Needed
- Any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

#### Procedure

##### Step 1: Creating an Account on Replit
1. **Navigate to the Replit website**: Open your web browser and go to [Replit.com](https://replit.com).
2. **Sign up for an account**: Click on the 'Sign Up' button and follow the prompts to create a new account. You will need to provide an email address, username, and password. Alternatively, you can sign up using a Google or GitHub account.

##### Step 2: Creating a New PHP Environment
1. **Log in to your dashboard**: Once your account is created, log in to access your Replit dashboard.
2. **Start a new project**:
   - Click the `Create` button located at the top left corner of the dashboard.
   - A pop-up will appear asking you to select a template.
   - Type 'PHP' in the search bar and select the **PHP web server** template.
3. **Name your project**:
   - Provide a name for your new project, such as "PHP Fundamentals".
   - Click `Create` to proceed.

##### Step 3: Configuring the Environment
1. **Wait for the environment to prepare**: Replit will automatically set up the environment; this may take a few moments.
2. **Adjust editor settings** (optional):
   - Navigate to the settings tab in the bottom left corner.
   - Increase the font size or make other adjustments to suit your preferences.

##### Step 4: Running Your First PHP Script
1. **Access the code editor**: Once the environment is ready, you will be directed to the code editor.
2. **Write a simple PHP script**:
   - In the code editor, type the following PHP code:
     ```php
     <?php
     echo "Hello World!";
     ?>
     ```
3. **Run the project**:
   - Click the `Run` button at the top of the page.
   - Replit will execute the PHP script, and a new preview tab will open displaying the output "Hello World".

##### Step 5: Organizing the Workspace
1. **Adjust the layout**:
   - If the console section is visible and not needed, you can merge it with the web view by dragging it around to reduce clutter.
   - Organize the workspace to display only the file tree, code editor, and preview sections.
