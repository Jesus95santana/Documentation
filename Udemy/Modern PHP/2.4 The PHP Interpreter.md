#### Definition and Nature of PHP  
- **PHP Defined**: PHP is an open-source, general-purpose scripting language designed for web development.  
- **Open Source Software (OSS)**: PHP is freely available for anyone to study, modify, and redistribute. It is one of the largest OSS projects globally, implying robust community support and continuous enhancement.  
- **Modification and Contributions**: Users can access and modify PHP’s source code, hosted on its official GitHub repository, allowing for personalized adjustments and contributions to its development.  
  
#### Capabilities and Usage of PHP  
- **General Purpose Language**: Initially created for web applications, PHP’s utility has expanded over time. Developers use PHP for command line scripts, desktop applications, image processing, and more, showcasing its versatility as a general-purpose language.  
- **Focus of the Course**: This course primarily concentrates on web development using PHP, though PHP’s capabilities span beyond this area.  
  
#### Technical Insights: Scripting and Programming  
- **Scripting vs. Programming Language**: PHP is both a scripting and a programming language. While all scripting languages are programming languages, not all programming languages are scripting languages.  
- **Interpreted Language**: PHP is an interpreted language, meaning it processes code line-by-line, translating it directly into machine code without creating an executable file. This contrasts with compiled languages, which convert the entire code into machine code at once and save it as an executable file.  
  
#### Execution of PHP Code  
- **Interpreter Role**: PHP uses an interpreter to transform PHP code into machine code that computers can execute. This is essential for running PHP scripts.  
- **Starting with PHP**: To begin using PHP, one must install the PHP interpreter. The upcoming lectures will guide learners through writing and executing their first PHP scripts using this interpreter.
