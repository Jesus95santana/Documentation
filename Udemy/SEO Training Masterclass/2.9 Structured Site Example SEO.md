**Introduction:**
The video tutorial aims to clarify the placement and handling of keywords within a website's structure, using the example of "Survive Agency" (a fictional entity), which is noted for its exemplary use of keyword targeting in its website architecture.

**Key Points:**

1. **Primary Keyword Targeting:**
   - **Homepage Focus**: The homepage of Survive Agency targets the primary keyword "digital marketing agency," which reflects the core business focus. This is crucial as the homepage often captures the highest volume of traffic and sets the thematic tone of the site.

2. **Secondary Keyword Strategy:**
   - **Service Pages**: Each service page on the website is dedicated to a specific service such as "product photography services." These pages are optimized for secondary, yet significant, keywords related to the specific services offered.
   - **Keyword Variations**: On these pages, the targeted keywords are used in various forms to enhance SEO without keyword stuffing, thereby maintaining content quality and relevance.

3. **Tertiary Content and Keywords:**
   - **Blog Section**: The 'Learn' section houses the blog which targets additional, less critical keywords through informative content. This section helps in drawing traffic through varied topics, contributing indirectly to the siteâ€™s SEO.
   - **Content Focus**: While these keywords are less critical for direct revenue, they support the site's overall SEO strategy by covering a broader range of related topics and engaging visitors with useful information.

4. **Additional Website Elements:**
   - **Non-SEO Focused Pages**: Pages like 'Portfolio', 'Contact Us', and 'About Us' serve more functional purposes and are less focused on SEO. They fulfill other essential aspects of user engagement and credibility.
   - **Sales Pages in E-commerce**: For e-commerce sites, product sales pages play a similar role to service pages in agency sites, targeting specific product-related keywords.

5. **Overall Site Structure and SEO Strategy:**
   - **Integrated Keyword Strategy**: The site effectively integrates various levels of keywords from the most revenue-generating to the less critical, ensuring a comprehensive approach to SEO.
   - **Content vs. Promotion**: While the homepage and service pages focus more on direct promotion and conversions, the blog and other informational content focus on engagement and indirect SEO benefits.
