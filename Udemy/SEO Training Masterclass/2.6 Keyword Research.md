#### Introduction
The video provides a step-by-step guide on how to use Google's Keyword Planner for SEO keyword research, emphasizing its utility and accessibility as a free tool within Google Ads.

#### Accessing Google Keyword Planner
1. **Avoid Direct Google Ads Signup**: Do not sign up directly through ads.google.com as it leads to a complicated ad setup process.
2. **Correct URL**: Use the specific URL: ads.google.com/intl/en_us/home/tools/keyword_planner. This directs you to the tool without unnecessary steps.
3. **Google Search Method**: Alternatively, you can Google search "Google Keyword Planner" and select the link that leads directly to the tool, bypassing ad setups.

#### Setting Up Google Ads Account
1. **Account Creation**: Create a new Google Ads account if you're new. Fill in the necessary account settings like location and time zone.
2. **Opt Out of Personalized Guidance**: Decline offers for personalized guidance from Google ad experts to avoid unnecessary complications.
3. **Completion**: Submit your information to finalize the account setup and access the Keyword Planner.

#### Using Google Keyword Planner
1. **Keyword Search**: Enter keywords relevant to your business (suggested length: 1-4 terms). Example used: "digital marketing agency".
2. **Analyzing Results**: Initial results show a range of average monthly searches. The precision of data increases if you run ads.
3. **Keyword Relevance**: Scroll through the results to identify relevant keywords that potential clients might use. Example: "digital marketing company", "digital marketing services". Avoid irrelevant keywords (e.g., "PPC agency" for businesses focusing on free traffic).

#### Key Features to Focus On
1. **Keywords and Average Monthly Searches**: These columns provide essential information for SEO planning.
2. **Ignore Ad-specific Data**: Columns like competition, three-month changes, and year-over-year changes are more relevant for paid ads than for SEO.

#### Importance of Google Keyword Planner
- **Definitive Volume Data**: Unlike other tools, Google Keyword Planner provides the most accurate data on search volumes, crucial for effective SEO.
- **Free Tool**: It remains a premier, free tool widely used in the SEO industry despite the availability of paid alternatives.
