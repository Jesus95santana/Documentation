**Introduction to Google Search Console:**
Google Search Console (GSC) is a vital tool provided by Google that helps website owners track page rankings for various keywords and perform numerous essential SEO tasks. It is recommended for regular use to effectively manage and optimize your website's presence in Google search results.

**Accessing Google Search Console:**
- Navigate to GSC by visiting [search.google.com/search-console/welcome](https://search.google.com/search-console/welcome).
- If you already have a domain, simply enter it and click 'Continue.'
- For new users, enter the URL of your new site.

**Setting Up a New Website:**
1. **Choose Verification Method:** Typically, the 'domain' option is recommended over the 'URL prefix' for new websites.
2. **Verification Process:**
   - The simplest method involves contacting your hosting provider (e.g., support@myhosting.com) and requesting them to upload a specific text provided by Google to your website.
   - Alternatively, for more technical users, Google provides instructions for verifying your domain via DNS settings which can vary based on the hosting provider.

**Verification Steps:**
- Follow Google’s instructions tailored to your DNS provider (e.g., Name.com).
- Add the verification text to your DNS records as specified.
- After adding the text, click 'Verify' on GSC. Verification might be immediate or take a few hours depending on the hosting provider.

**Navigating Verification Challenges:**
- If the process seems confusing, Google offers detailed guides and an official video tutorial that can be accessed by clicking 'full details' during the verification process.
- The video highlights critical steps at specific timestamps, helping users through the verification process with their specific hosting providers.

**Post-Verification:**
1. **Accessing Your Site on GSC:** Once verification is confirmed, enter your verified website URL, and you’ll be directed to your GSC property dashboard.
2. **Exploration of Features:** GSC provides insights into traffic, keyword rankings, and other vital SEO metrics. Further exploration of these features is often covered in additional tutorials or guides.

**Account Requirements:**
- A Gmail account is necessary to use Google Search Console. Ensure you are logged into Google with your Gmail account when using GSC.
