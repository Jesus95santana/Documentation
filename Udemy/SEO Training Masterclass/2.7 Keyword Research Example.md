**Introduction:**
The text provides a detailed guide on how to effectively use the Google Keyword Tool to optimize search results for a business coaching website. It highlights the challenges and strategies involved in selecting the right keywords to attract potential clients.

**Main Points:**

1. **Understanding Keyword Search Volume and Intent:**
   - The primary keyword example used is "business coach," which has a monthly search volume of 8,000. However, the intent behind these searches varies, as some may want to hire a business coach while others might be looking to become one.
   - The broadness of the term "business coach" makes it difficult to ascertain the true intent of the search, thus potentially reducing the effectiveness of this keyword in targeting the desired audience.

2. **Analyzing Competition:**
   - Typing "business coach" into Google reveals high competition from established entities like HubSpot, Tony Robbins, and other prominent figures or organizations. This competition makes it challenging to rank well using this keyword.
   - The competition column in the Google Keyword Tool refers to ad competition, not organic SEO competition.

3. **Exploring Long-Tail Keywords:**
   - To circumvent the high competition for generic keywords, the text suggests using long-tail keywords which are more specific and less contested.
   - Examples provided include "Amazon FBA business coach," "business coaching services," and "affiliate marketing coach." These keywords help in targeting more specific audiences and face lower competition.

4. **Local Search Implications:**
   - Keywords like "business coach near me" indicate local search intent. Although they show high search volume, the actual applicable audience is much smaller and localized.

5. **Successful Keyword Utilization Example:**
   - The author shares a personal success story using the keyword "affiliate marketing coach," which despite having a lower search volume (110 searches per month), ranked well organically on Google, attracting lucrative clients over several years without intensive SEO efforts.

6. **Diversifying Keyword Strategy:**
   - Itâ€™s beneficial to create multiple targeted pages for various coaching services like spiritual, life, or executive coaching, depending on one's expertise. This approach helps in capturing a variety of clients across different niches.
