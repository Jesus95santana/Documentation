Appending edits to a commit that has already been pushed to a remote repository in Git can be tricky since it involves altering the history. Here are the steps to safely amend and push a commit that has already been shared:

## Step 1: Amend the Local Commit
First, make the necessary changes to your files. Then, stage these changes:
```bash
git add .
```
Next, amend the commit:
```bash
git commit --amend
```
This command opens your editor to modify the commit message if necessary. Save and close the editor to proceed.

## Step 2: Force Push the Amended Commit
Because the history has been altered, a regular push won't work. You will need to force push. However, to ensure that you do not overwrite others' work:
```bash
git push --force-with-lease
```
The `--force-with-lease` option ensures that you do not overwrite others' changes on the same branch. If someone else has pushed changes, it will refuse to push, and you'll need to pull their changes first.

## Note
If you're working in a team or if the commit has been part of the history for some time, consider making a new commit with the additional changes rather than amending and force pushing. This preserves the integrity of the repository history and avoids potential conflicts with other team members' work.
