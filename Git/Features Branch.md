## Step 1: Update Your Main Branch
Ensure your local main branch is up-to-date with the remote repository to avoid conflicts and ensure integration compatibility.

**Switch to the main branch:**
```bash
git checkout main
```

**Pull the latest changes from the remote:**
```bash
git pull origin main
```

## Step 2: Create a New Feature Branch
Isolate development work by using a feature-specific branch created from an updated main branch.

**Create and switch to a new branch (name it appropriately based on the feature):**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

## Step 3: Develop the Feature
Perform your coding tasks within this branch. Regularly commit your changes to save progress and clarify development steps.

**Make changes and test your code thoroughly.**

**Stage your changes for a commit:**
```bash
git add .
```

**Commit your changes with a descriptive message:**
```bash
git commit -m "Detailed description of what was changed"
```

## Step 4: Push Feature Branch to Remote
Once youâ€™ve made significant progress or completed the feature, push the branch to GitHub.

**Push your feature branch to the remote repository:**
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## Step 5: Create a Pull Request
Initiate a review process through a pull request to merge your feature into the main branch.

1. Go to the GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to the "Pull Requests" section and click "New pull request."
3. Select your feature branch and the main branch to compare.
4. Click "Create pull request."
5. Provide a comprehensive description of the changes and mention any specific concerns or testing needed.

## Step 6: Review and Merge
Collaborate with your team to review the changes. Address feedback and make necessary adjustments.

- Respond to comments and make additional commits if changes are required.
- Once approved, merge the pull request into the main branch.

## Step 7: Clean Up
After merging, clean up your branches to keep the repository tidy.

**Delete the feature branch from the remote repository:**
```bash
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature-name
```

**Optionally, clean up your local branches:**
```bash
git branch -d feature/your-feature-name
```
